The process module allows you to interact with the system process, 
the child_process module allows you to actually execute code on a separate process,
and the cluster module allows you to create a cluster of HTTP or TCP servers.

child_process provides the exec(), execFile(), spawn(), and fork() functions, which start work on separate processes.
